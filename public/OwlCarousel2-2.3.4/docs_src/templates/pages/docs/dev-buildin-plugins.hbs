## Built-in Plugins
> Owl Carousel supports plugin modular structure. This means that you can remove plugins that you won’t use or create new ones that fit your needs



### Plugins included

Following javascript files are concatenated in distributed owl.carousel.js and owl.carousel.min.js version. If you are looking for individual scripts please visit [Github]({{ pkg.homepage }}) and fork/download the source project


```

└── js/
	├── owl.animate.js
    ├── owl.autoplay.js
    ├── owl.autoheight.js
    ├── owl.carousel.js
    ├── owl.hash.js
    ├── owl.lazyload.js
    ├── owl.navigation.js
    └── owl.video.js
```

Big thanks to [Artus Kolanowski](https://github.com/witrin) for helping me with modular structure and for providing best practice with developing the code.

## owl.lazyload.js

LazyLoad require `class="owl-lazy"` and link to image inside data: data-src="url_to_img" or/and data-src-retina="url_to_highres_img".
There is also option to load images into background but this needs to be tested. [See demo](/demos/demo.html)

Usage:

```
$('.owl-carousel').owlCarousel({
	lazyLoad:true
});
```
HTML Markup:
```
<div class="owl-carousel">
	<img class="owl-lazy" data-src="https://placehold.it/350x250&text=3" alt="">
	<img class="owl-lazy" data-src-retina="https://placehold.it/350x250&text=1-retina" data-src="https://placehold.it/350x250&text=1" alt="">
	<div class="owl-lazy" data-src-retina="https://placehold.it/350x250&text=1-retina" data-src="https://placehold.it/350x250&text=1"></div>
</div>
```
